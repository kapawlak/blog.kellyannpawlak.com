I finally got around to coding up a rudimentary "Content Management System" for myself. Anyone who knows me professionally, knows that I am a stickler for customizable and creative communication. It is *exceptionally* important to me that I can design layouts, writing, graphics and interactive demonstrations in a way that fit my specific needs. I felt that a lot of the "out-of-box"solutions available for website \& blog generation only got me 80% of the way there.

The machinery isn't perfect &mdash; a lot of it is repurposed code from other projects I've thrown together in the past three years &mdash; but it should do for now. Hopefully it won't be too buggy for anyone reading :). Let me know if you run into any issues and I will try to remedy them.

Ultimately, having finally built my site, I'm looking forward to *actually* posting some *interesting* content!
