# About Me

I am a Quantum Application Scientist working in the Quantum Industry. In long form, my title means that (ideally;;;I should note, however, that we are currently in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum computing (NISQ) era, so I often will have to play with (or around) the lower layers of the stack to make things "work" &mdash; e.g. employing error mitigation strategies;;;) I am working on the top layer of the quantum computing technology stack: designing algorithms and software packages ("applications") that allow whomever to use a quantum computer to solve some interesting problem. This is similar in nature to scientists and software engineers that write code that runs in C or python to solve scientific or industrial problems, except that this code runs on a classical CPU rather than a QPU. 

Prior to working in the Quantum Industry, I was a Condensed Matter Physicist, and earned my Ph.D. at University of California Santa Barbara. I focused mainly on quantum phase transitions, with a special interest in realizations of "unconventional superconductivity", which includes High Temperature Superconductivity (HTSC). My favorite tool was the Renormalization Group ;;;more or less: a fancy, if not bloody, version of the 'Central Limit Theorem';;; and I applied it to everything. During the last years of my study, I began to feel that quantum computing and quantum simulation were a promising path for advancing condensed matter and materials physics: theory and numerics can only get one so far, and experiments often can't keep up with data demand. I decided to change course and head into the quantum industry after a short break after graduation.

## October 5 2022

I finally got around to coding up a rudimentary "Content Management System" for myself. Anyone who knows me professionally, knows that I am a stickler for customizable and creative communication. It is *exceptionally* important to me that I can design mathematical displays, layouts, writing, graphics and interactive demonstrations in ways that fit my specific needs. I felt that a lot of the "out-of-box" solutions available for website \& blog generation only got me 80% of the way there. So here we are.

The machinery isn't perfect &mdash; a lot of it is repurposed code from other projects I've thrown together in the past three years &mdash; but it should do for now. Hopefully it won't be too buggy for anyone reading :). Let me know if you run into any issues and I will try to remedy them.

Ultimately, having finally built my site, I'm looking forward to *actually* posting some *interesting* content!
